Well if you've been a married woman
And things didn't seem to work out
Divorce is the key to bein' loose and free
So you're gonna be talked about
Everybody knows that you've loved once
They think you'll love again
You can't have a male friend when you're a has been
Or a woman you're rated X

And if you're rated X you're some kind of goal
Even men turnin' silver try to make
But I think it's wrong to judge every picture
If a cheap camera makes a mistake
And when your best friend's husband says to you
You've sure started lookin' good
You should've known he would
And he would if he could

And he will if you're rated X

Well nobody knows where you're goin'
But they sure know where you've been
All their thinkin' of is your experience of love
Their minds eat up with sin
The women all look at you like you're bad
And the men all hope you are
But if you go too far you're gonna wear the scar
Of a woman rated X
And if you're rated X
And if you're rated X you're some kind of goal
Even men turnin' silver try to make
But I think it's wrong to judge every picture
If a cheap camera makes a mistake
And when your best friend's husband says to you
You've started lookin' good
You should've known he would

And he would if he could
And he will if you're rated X

Well us women don't have a chance
'Cause if you've been married you can't no fun at all
No you're rated X
No matter what you do they're goin' to talk about you
Look down their noses
