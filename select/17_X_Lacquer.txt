I am fed up with thinking
That my life could be a work of art
I go drifting in circles
Through the nothingness of my heart
I could work but i'm lazy
I could sleep... don't tempt me!

I don't wanna end like an
Ex-rated music star:
Broke and loveless
I wanna be desired like an
X-rated music star:
No limit and cold as ice
Cold as ice

I'll do anything to make myself
Visible
I'll give anything to make myself
Eatable
Down the street I go crazy
Look at me I'm so sexy

I don't wanna end like an
Ex-rated music star:
Broke and loveless
I wanna be desired like an
X-rated music star:
No limit and cold as ice
Cold as ice...

I don't wanna end like an
Ex-rated music star:
Broke and loveless
I wanna be desired like an
X-rated music star:
No limit and cold as ice
